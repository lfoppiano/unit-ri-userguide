The out-of-the-box **Units** class in the reference implementation includes support for units (and quantities) defined in the following documents:
* BIPM units (same as ISO 1000), including:
 - [Base units](http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section2-1.html)
 - [Coherent derived units in the SI with special names and symbols](http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/table3.html)
 - [Derived units expressed in terms of base units](http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section2-2-1.html) (a reasonable subset based on broad usage)
 - * [Decimal multiples and submultiples of SI units](http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html)
* Special constant ONE, a Dimensionless unit
