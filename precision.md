# Data and precision management

One important part of the unit of measurement business is the possibility to make conversions:
 - Conversion between System of unit (e.g. SI to US system). 
 - Scaling, when values are transformed to more appropriate scale (e.g. moving from kilometers to astronomical units).

Uom-se supportes both double/Double and Number. As a best practice the usage of double primitive or the Double object should be avoided.
