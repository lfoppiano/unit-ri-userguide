# Overview

The JSR 363 reference implementation (RI) provides both an implementation of the interfaces defined in the API section of this specification, and some helpful elements which are not part of the API. The RI provides different Unit implementations depending on their role, for example a distinct <code>BaseUnit</code> class.
